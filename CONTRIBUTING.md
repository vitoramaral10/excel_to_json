## How to contribute

Want to contribute to the project? We will be proud to highlight you as one of our collaborators. Here are some points where you can contribute and make excel to json even better.

- Helping to translate the readme into other languages.
- Adding documentation to the readme (a lot of Get's functions haven't been documented yet).
- Write articles or make videos teaching how to use Get (they will be inserted in the Readme and in the future in our Wiki).
- Offering PRs for code/tests.
- Including new functions.

Any contribution is welcome!
